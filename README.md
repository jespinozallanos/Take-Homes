:eye: Diabetic Retinopathy

Through	Kaggle's	Diabetic	Retinopathy	Detection	competition, 35,126	high-resolution retina images were used in	order	to	create	an	automated	analysis	system	that	assigns	a	score	to	images rating	presence	of	diabetic	retinopathy or not. Results	from	the	model	returned	82%	Training	Accuracy,	80%	Testing	Accuracy,	88%	Precision and	77%	Recall.	Results	were	very	good	due	to	image	pre-processing.	For	patients	suspected with	Diabetic	Retinopathy,	this	is	implemented	to	provide	accurate	and	efficient	diagnosis.
